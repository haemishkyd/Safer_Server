# SAfer Server
This is an android application linked to a project call **SAfer**.

This is an emergency response application based on finding the closest security company responder based on their having this same app open. 
This is (obviously) an Uber type model.

The android application for this server - since the users all need to interract with this server somehow - can be found in this  [project](https://github.com/haemishkyd/Safer_Android).
